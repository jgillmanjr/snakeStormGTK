snakeStormGTK
============

A *highly* experimental GTK interface for Liquid Web's Storm API utilizing the [snakeStorm](https://github.com/jgillmanjr/snakeStorm) module.

You'll need GTK, as well as the `snakeStorm` python package as well as [PyGObject](http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)

snakeStorm can be installed with `pip install snakeStorm`

Currently only 'simple' parameters can be passed in (so you can't pass in hashes or lists as part of the param)
